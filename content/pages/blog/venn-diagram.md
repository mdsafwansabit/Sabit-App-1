A **Venn diagram** is a visual representation of sets and their relationships to each other. It uses overlapping circles to show how different sets intersect, differ, or share common elements. Each circle in the diagram represents a set, and the areas where the circles overlap show the elements that are shared between those sets.

Key features of a Venn diagram include:

1.  **Circles**: Each circle represents a different set.

2.  **Overlapping Areas**: Where circles overlap, it shows the elements that are common to both sets.

3.  **Non-overlapping Areas**: Areas where the circles don't overlap show the elements that are unique to each set.

Venn diagrams are commonly used in mathematics, logic, statistics, and probability theory to visualize relationships between different groups, such as:

*   Showing common or unique elements between sets

*   Illustrating logical relationships (like AND, OR, NOT)

*   Comparing different categories or groups.

For example, a Venn diagram of two sets, **A** and **B**, can show:

*   Elements only in **A**

*   Elements only in **B**

*   Elements common to both **A** and **B**

Venn diagrams can have more than two sets, and as more sets are added, the diagram becomes more complex.
